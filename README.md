## EmoClassifier
# By Ahmed, Jawad; Baun, Niklas; Chandio, Murtaza; Scheil, Lennart

EmoClassifier is a project to predict emotions for given text using a pre-trained model. 
The model is based on the BERT architecture and fine-tuned on a dataset of text labeled with emotions.
5 different emotions are supported: anger, fear, joy, love, and sadness.

## Instructions
the project can be run in the main.py file.
because Ilias doesn't support files larger than 200MB, the model is not included in the repository.
To use the predict function the model has to be trained first.
This happens in the main.py file. If no model is found.

So if some other function will be used to evaluate the model, the model has to be trained first.
